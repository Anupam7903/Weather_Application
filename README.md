# Weather_Application
	Developed an application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to get weather details of the specific city.
	Used city name as input from the user and create a HTTP request and send it to Openweathermap.org API to get back the details in the form of a JSON Response.
	Tested on 10+ cities and it works with the efficiency of 100%.
